# Programming Rookie Training

Welcome new Talon540 rookies, this document will be used to introduce you guys to how Robotics and Programming a robot work. In programming, your job is to program the robot to use its motors and parts and interact with the world!

## Coding Lessons
**Your learning can be self paced, however the minimum times you must complete training is listed below**
- [Week 1: Java Fundamentals](/CodingLessons/JavaLessons/JavaFundamentals.md)
- [Week 2: Functional Programming]()
- [Week 3: Object Oriented Programming]()
- [Week 4: Github and Git Workflow]()

## Robot Code
**Robot-related learning. Follows the same rules as the coding lessons**
