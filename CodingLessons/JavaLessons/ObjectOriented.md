## Being Object-Oriented
A unique feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability to encapsulate information and abstract that information so that it's not accessible to all parts of code. 
Then, using that feature, be able to inherit information from object to object, while maintaining the ability to keep that info editable, making it polymorphic.
