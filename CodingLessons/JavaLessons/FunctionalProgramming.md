An important extension of Java, and my coding languages, is the ability to define a **function.**
## Reusing Code ##
- Often times, you will have to repeat a common piece of code in a program.
- It would be inconvenient to have to re-write the code every time, so we define functions.

- Lambda expressions are a more advanced way of defining functions used for niche purposes
- They can be extremely useful in more complicated sections of code.
