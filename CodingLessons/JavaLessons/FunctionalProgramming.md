Examples of written classes for the previous year, Rapid React, the classes were written in the Modules folder, linked below. They contain static methods, so in the Robot.java file, the class followed by the method is called, rather than making a constructor and then calling the object name.

- [Modules Folder](RobotCode-v14/src/main/java/frc/robot/Modules)

These are called with their file name followed by method name, like "Climbers.climb()" in [Robot.java file](RobotCode-v14/src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java)
