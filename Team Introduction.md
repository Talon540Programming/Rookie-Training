## **Introduction to the Team**
Talon540 leadership has several parts and can get confusing quickly. The highest members of Talon's chain of command are our administration members. They consist of Project Manager, Team Captain, and Club Leader.

**For the 2022-23 season, our team Admins are:**
- Project Manager: XXXX <!-- TODO: -->
- Team Captain: XXXX <!-- TODO: -->
- Club Leader: Earl H Hurlburt

Furthermore, each subgroup has its own leads and co-leads. This is done to better manage the team and subgroups as a whole. It also decreases the number of people going to team admins as they can get busy throughout the year.
